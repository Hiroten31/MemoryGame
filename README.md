# Java Learning
Recalling and learning new stuff about Java. The most simple programs to train structural programming. And yes, I see all of those mistakes I made :sweat_smile:
Note: Repository is called 'Java Learning', because there was more Java programms, but they weren't anything worth saving 

## Memory Game
### How to run the program?  
  
Import it to your IDE and choose SDK. Then just run the .java
 file! :grin:  
  
### Program that will play a memory game with you using words.

You can determine how much rows and collumns will be there:  
![rowscols](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97809912/223875930-ff7f9ab0-1111-4398-a17f-690615b6c7f1.png)

Then program will randomly pick right amount of words from 'words.txt' file.

The program also will scale itself to look slick and compactly :star_struck:  
Longest word:
- 6:

- 9:

To play you will need to give the row and colums of 'X' you want to uncover.  
![words1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97809912/223876985-a3321c26-d8f7-4278-92e2-a44090d79dba.png)
![words2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97809912/223876992-e5ba0a9d-83e9-4e35-8b94-b100a22d1858.png)

The program won't allow you to enter the same coordinates or coordinates of already uncovered word! :no_entry:  
  
The score at the end is determine by amount of hearths you have left and amount of words to guess :heart:	:heart:	:heart:
